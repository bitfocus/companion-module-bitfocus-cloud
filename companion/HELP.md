# Bitfocus Companion Cloud 

This module serves as a client for the Bitfocus Companion Cloud system, a cloud-based solution that enables remote access to Companion servers without requiring VPNs or complex network configurations.

## Premium Service

Please note that Companion Cloud is a premium, paid service and is not included in the open-source portion of Companion.

## How it works (Upon Release)

1. Purchase a Companion Cloud license at https://user.bitfocus.io
2. Download a version of Companion with Cloud capabilities (not yet available in the stable release)
3. Navigate to the cloud section in the GUI and log in using your Bitfocus account credentials
4. Connect to the nearest cloud regions for optimal performance

Once connected, you can control Companion from the user area on the website or use this module to integrate buttons from your remote Companion instance into another Companion. Your remote Companion will appear in the familiar "presets" section, allowing you to drag and drop it onto your local Companion button. This lets you combine both local and remote actions on a single button if desired.

## Support
